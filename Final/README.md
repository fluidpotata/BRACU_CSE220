### Final Question

- <b> Question-01 </b> <br>
a. Show the simulation of the following queue where + is enqued, # is dequeue and * is peek.<br>
```           12+9+3+*#*7+#**#           ```                                               \[3 Marks] <br>
b. Suppose you're given an object created with class Enqueue. The class has enqueue(), dequeue(), peek() properly implemented. Write a python program that will remove the even elements from the queue. <br>
Example: Given Queue: 3->2->6->5->7->9 <br>
Result: 3->5->7->9 <br>                                  \[7 Marks]

- <b> Question-02 </b> <br>
Suppose you're given the head of a tree. Count the total number of the nodes that tree contains reccursively. \(Following any other way will result in no marks)  \[10 Marks]<br>

- <b> Question-03 </b><br>
```Team | Total Played | Total Win```<br>
```---------- | -- | -------------```<br>
```Bangladesh | 10 | 5```<br>
```India      | 10 | 7``` <br>
```Pakistan   | 10 | 8``` <br>
```Australia  | 10 | 5``` <br>
```Sri Lanka  | 10 | 5```<br>
a. Given the data, Tyrion wants to create a hash table of size 3, while Davos wants to create a hash table of size 5. If the datas are not likely to change, whose approach is more optimized? \[3 Marks] <br>
b. If this is the hash function of Davos: <br>
```           index = Total win%5           ```<br> 
Write the code to make the hash table. Use <b> Linear Probing </b> to avoid collision.  \[7 Marks]<br>

- <b> Question-04 </b><br>
  a. ```[70,30,23,45,85,75,90,27,77]                  ``` \[5 Marks]<br> 
    i. Draw the binary tree from the given arrow.<br>
    ii. From the tree, write the values in pre-order printing.<br>
    iii. From the values of <i>ii</i>, draw the binary searching tree.<br>
  b. You have been given a node of a binary search tree. Write a python program to remove the node using predesessor. \[6 Marks] <br>
  c. You have been given the root of a binary search tree. Write a program to find the highest height of the tree. \[6 Marks] <br>
